# Angular Sliding Panels and Data Validation

This repository exists in support of my questions about AngularJS on StackOverflow, so there is a simple way to grab all the code at once. 

In particular, I'm asking about 
* why I can't call a function to set a variable
* where and how to change the code so it works

Once I've posted them, I'll update this README with links to the questions. If things work out, I'll update the code and push the changes so others can benefit.

Uses original code from [AngularJS Pageslide Directive](https://github.com/danielepiccone/ng-pageslide) on GitHub.

The client-side 'do not track' code is from  [How to detect and use ‘Do Not Track’ on your website](https://medium.com/farewill/how-to-detect-and-use-do-not-track-on-your-website-77f21f62be48) on Medium.
